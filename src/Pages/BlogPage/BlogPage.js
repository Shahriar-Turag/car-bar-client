                            Javascript is a Scripting language. It is mostly
                            abbreviated as JS. It can be said that Javascript is
                            the updated version of the ECMA script. Javascript
                            is a high-level programming language that uses the
                            concept of Oops but it is based on prototype
                            inheritance.

                            NodeJS is a cross-platform and opensource Javascript

                            run on the server-side. Nodejs allows Javascript
                            code to run outside the browser. Nodejs comes with a
                            lot of modules and mostly used in web development.

                            needs a programming environment and a runtime

                            tools/support and can compile and/or interpret your
                            code. Nodejs is such as tool for the Javascript
                            programming language. There are other similar tools
                            for other languages such as Python, Java, PHP, C#,

                            So, if you want to write some kind of stand-alone
                            program or server in Javascript, then you can use
                            nodejs for it.

                            update it later, then you would typically use some

                            databases. MongoDB is one such database. MariaDB,

                            examples of other databases. Different databases
                            have different strengths (things they are best at)
                            and different ways of using them so it's a whole

                            predefined schema. SQL databases are not suited for
                            hierarchical data storage. It is not possible to

                            NoSQL databases are suited for hierarchical data
                            storage. They are not suited for storing large

                            amount of data. These databases are not so good for
                            complex queries.
